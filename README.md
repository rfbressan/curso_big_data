## INFERÊNCIA CAUSAL COM MACHINE LEARNING: uma aplicação para evasão fiscal

(Causal Inference with Machine Learning: an application to tax evasion)

This is a _Lato Sensu_ specialization capstone project where I try to first, replicate the results from Fellner et al. (2013) and second, extend it by 
using novel machine learning techniques to infer heterogenous treatment effects, (Chernozhukov et al., 2018 and Athey, Tibshirani, Wager et al., 2019).

Codes in R and Python are provided.
